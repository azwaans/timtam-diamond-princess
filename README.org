#+title: Diamond Princess COVID-19 analysis

This repository provides code to run an analysis of data collected
during an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 onboard the Diamond Princess. The
analysis is based off a previous analysis from [[https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syac037][Andr√©oletti /et al/
(2022)]] and uses the [[https://aezarebski.github.io/timtam/][TimTam]] package for BEASTv2.

* Model

See the [[file:./model.org]] document which describes the model.

* Running analysis

This assumes that you have [[https://ant.apache.org/][Apache Ant]], [[https://cran.r-project.org/][R]] and [[https://www.java.com/en/][Java]] installed.

** Getting help

The computations are coordinated with Ant. To get a list of the
various targets it knows how to build run the following:

#+begin_src sh
  ant -p
#+end_src

** Setting up BEAST2

#+begin_src sh
  ant setuplib
#+end_src

Note that this will only set up the relevant BEAST tools. You will
still need to install the TimTam package via BEAUti.

** Running the analysis

*** Optional: generation of XML

#+begin_src sh
  ant preprocess	# proprocess data
  ant beauti		# generate XML
#+end_src

Getting to the final XML files used is not an entirely automated
process, and making it so would likely be counter productive.

*** MCMC

#+begin_src sh
  ant mcmc
#+end_src

*WARNING:* The XML reads sequences in from =data/diamond.fasta= which
is not part of this repository. See the [[file:./data/readme.org][README]] in that directory for
details.

*** Postprocessing

#+begin_src sh
  ant postprocess
#+end_src
